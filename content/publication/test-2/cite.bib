abstract = {Traffic condition in Yogyakarta City faces growing volume each year. Meanwhile, the development of road is increasingly harder to expand due to limited availability of lands and funds. Therefore, evaluation of road networks is needed to avoid, reduce and eliminate traffic congestion in Yogyakarta. In this study, the authors aim to build road network model representing traffic condition in Yogykarta. Capacity restraint method is used for traffic assignment with the assistance of ZIN software. ZIN capability to model complex road networks is also assessed.}
