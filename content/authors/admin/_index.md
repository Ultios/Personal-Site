Hello there, I'm Aulia Rahman, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my corner of the web üéâ

I'm currently a Doctoral 2nd year student from Fukuda Lab, University of Tokyo.

I wear many hats in the world of transportation. I'm a data scientist, transport modeler, transport consultant, transport planner, software developer, and (wannabe) writer. This website serves as a window into my world of research and exploration. Here, you'll find a collection of my academic work, publications, and insights, along with plethora of other interest.

I also manage my father‚Äôs small business part time, mostly on financial and strategic planning.

You can find me across various platforms, including Twitter (now X), Instagram, Google Scholar, and GitHub. So, let's embark on this data-driven journey together!
