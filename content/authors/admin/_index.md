Hello there, I'm Aulia Rahman, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my corner of the web üéâ

I wear many hats in the world of transportation. I'm a data scientist, transport modeler, transport consultant, transport planner, software developer, and (wannabe) writer. This website serves as a window into my world of research and exploration. Here, you'll find a collection of my academic work, publications, and insights, along with plethora of other interest.

One of my passions is promoting reproducible research to tackle the barrier which restricts common people participation towards sustainable transportation planning. 

I also specialise in localising various transportation parameters invented by developed countries through new (hopefully, easier) approach for mixed traffic flow behaviour commonly found in low middle income countries.

From time to time, I also share blog posts and other musings. If you'd like to connect or discuss anything related to the fascinating world of data and transportation, feel free to reach out üöÄ

Currently I‚Äôm searching for PhD opportunities to develop my interest into meaningful research for the communities.

I also manage my father‚Äôs small business from time to time, mostly on financial and strategic planning. I tried to apply my programming skills to create automated system for it with future application on Business Analytics to make more better informed and adaptive business decisions.

You can find me across various platforms, including Twitter (now X), Instagram, Google Scholar, and GitHub. So, let's embark on this data-driven journey together!
